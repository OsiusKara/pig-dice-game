        <ul>
          <li>❇️ The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
          <br>
          <li>❇️ In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his Current score</li>
          <br>
          <li>❇️ BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his Current score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
          <br>
          <li>❇️ The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his Current score gets added to his GLOBAL score &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it's the next player's turn</li>
          <br>
          <li>❇️ The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game</li>
      </ul>
